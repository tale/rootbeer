--- @class rootbeer
--- Primitives for managing files, creating symlinks, and querying system information.

--- Information about the current host machine and user.
--- See `host.lua` for the full type definition.
--- @type rootbeer.HostInfo
rootbeer.host = {}

--- The first-class profile system. See `profile.lua` for the full type
--- definition.
--- @type profile
rootbeer.profile = {}

--- Absolute path to the rootbeer source directory (the directory containing
--- the entry-point script). Useful for commands that need to operate on the
--- source repo itself (e.g. `git remote set-url`).
--- @type string
rootbeer.source_dir = ""

--- Reads a UTF-8 file during planning. Relative paths resolve from the source
--- directory; paths starting with `~` expand to the home directory.
--- @param path string File to read.
--- @return string content File contents, including whitespace.
function rootbeer.read_file(path) end

--- Writes content to a file. Parent directories are created automatically.
--- Paths starting with `~` are expanded to `$HOME`; relative paths resolve
--- from the script directory.
--- @param path string The destination file path.
--- @param content string The content to write.
function rootbeer.file(path, content) end

--- Reads a file from disk at plan time and returns its contents as a string.
--- Useful for inlining shell snippets, templates, or any other text resource
--- alongside your Lua configuration (the Nix `builtins.readFile` equivalent).
--- Paths starting with `~` are expanded to `$HOME`; relative paths resolve
--- from the script directory. Reads happen immediately during plan, not
--- during apply.
--- @param path string The source file path.
--- @return string content The file's contents.
function rootbeer.read_file(path) end

--- Creates a symbolic link from a file in the script directory.
--- The source path is relative to the script directory and must exist.
--- The destination supports `~` expansion.
--- Idempotent — existing correct links are skipped, stale links are replaced.
--- @param src string Source path relative to the script directory.
--- @param dst string Destination path (supports `~` expansion).
function rootbeer.link_file(src, dst) end

--- Copies a file from the script directory to the destination, but only if
--- the destination does not already exist. Useful for seeding configuration
--- files that the user (or an application) is expected to modify after the
--- initial bootstrap (e.g. an editor config that records UI state).
--- The source path is relative to the script directory and must exist.
--- The destination supports `~` expansion. If the destination already exists,
--- the operation is reported as `skip`.
--- @param src string Source path relative to the script directory.
--- @param dst string Destination path (supports `~` expansion).
function rootbeer.copy_file(src, dst) end

--- Creates a symbolic link between arbitrary paths.
--- Both paths support `~` expansion and relative path resolution.
--- Unlike `link_file`, the source is not restricted to the script directory.
--- The source must exist at plan time.
--- @param src string Source path (supports `~` expansion).
--- @param dst string Destination path (supports `~` expansion).
function rootbeer.link(src, dst) end

--- Executes a command in the source directory. The command is deferred until the apply stage.
--- @param cmd string The command to run (e.g. `"brew"`).
--- @param args? string[] Optional arguments passed to the command.

--- @class rootbeer.PackageSpec
--- @field name string Package name.

--- @field output_sha256? string Verified installed-tree hash.
--- @field runtime_dependencies? table<string, rootbeer.PackageSpec> Exact runtime packages keyed by name@version; each requires output_sha256.

--- @class rootbeer.PackageSource
--- @field path? string Local directory tree source. The `sha256` is a deterministic tree hash.
--- @field file? string Local source file, usually an archive. The `sha256` is a byte hash.
--- @field url? string HTTPS, digest-pinned `ghcr://`, or `file://` source URL. The `sha256` is a byte hash.
--- @field sha256 string Locked source hash.

--- @class rootbeer.PackageOptions
--- @field source? boolean Build the selected approved release from source instead of using a prebuilt.
--- @field head? boolean Build the declared development branch, resolved to a commit in the lock.
--- @field tag? string Build this literal Git tag from the recipe's source repository.
--- @field rev? string Build this full lowercase Git commit SHA from the recipe's source repository.
--- @field branch? string Build this Git branch, resolved to a commit in the lock.
--- @field asset? string Exact GitHub release asset filename. Required when platform selection is ambiguous.
--- @field bins? table<string, string> Binary name → relative path in the GitHub asset. Defaults to executable discovery for archives, or the repository name for raw binaries.

--- @field asset? string Exact release asset filename for an explicit github: request.
--- @field bins? table<string, string> Exported command name → relative path for an explicit github: request.

--- @class rootbeer.PackageRepository
--- @field url string HTTPS URL of the repository's signed root (`.../current.json`), or an explicit absolute `file:///` URL.
--- @field public_key string The repository's Ed25519 verification key, as 64 lowercase hexadecimal characters.

--- Loads registry-format Lua recipes from a local directory, relative to the config.
--- Call once, before declaring packages. Local names and aliases take precedence
--- over the selected repository. Planning only reads recipes; apply resolves downloads
--- and executes source builds. Recipe contents are tracked in `rootbeer.lock`.
--- @param path string Directory containing one schema-2 `<name>.lua` file per package.
function rootbeer.package_catalog(path) end

--- Uses another package repository in place of the official one for canonical
--- package requests. Call once, before declaring packages. Planning performs no
--- downloads; apply verifies the repository's signed root and records the exact
--- root in `rootbeer.lock`, and `rb apply --update` moves it forward.
--- @param spec rootbeer.PackageRepository
function rootbeer.package_repository(spec) end

--- Installs a command-line tool, such as `"ripgrep"`. Use `"name@version"`
--- to choose an exact version. Package versions are saved in `rootbeer.lock`.
--- You can also use `github:owner/repo@tag`, `aqua:owner/repo@version`,
--- or a table describing an exact download and installation.
--- @param spec string|rootbeer.PackageRequestSpec|rootbeer.PackageSpec Package name, source request with options, or exact package specification.
--- @param opts? rootbeer.PackageOptions Source selection for canonical packages, or asset options for explicit `github:` requests.
function rootbeer.package(spec, opts) end

--- Declares a dense package list in order. Accepts the same entries as package().
--- Validates every entry before adding operations; errors identify the invalid index.
--- @param specs (string|rootbeer.PackageRequestSpec|rootbeer.PackageSpec)[] Package declarations.

--- Returns the stable Rootbeer profile path for a managed binary, or `nil`

--- Source this file from your shell configuration to use installed commands.
